However, nitrogen is a highly mobile nutrient in the soil and can easily leach or wash away if applied too early in the growing season. Therefore, to ensure that the plants have an adequate and readily available nitrogen supply during their active growth phase, nitrogenous fertilizers are often applied as top dressing when the plants are well-established.\n\nCrop demand for nitrogen: Many crops, including maize, have a high demand for nitrogen during their vegetative growth stage. By applying nitrogenous fertilizers as top dressing during this period, it helps meet the crop's nutrient requirements when they need it the most. This timing allows for optimal nitrogen utilization by the plants and promotes vigorous vegetative growth.\n\nMinimizing nitrogen losses: By applying nitrogenous fertilizers as top dressing, farmers can better manage and minimize nitrogen losses from leaching or volatilization. Top dressing allows for a more targeted application directly to the root zone, reducing the risk of nutrient runoff or wastage. It also ensures that the nitrogen remains available to the plants when they require it, improving nutrient efficiency and minimizing environmental impacts.": 2596, "Implement terracing, Plant cover crops, Build retaining walls": 2597, "ebanga lya mita 1-1.5 wakati w\u2019ennyiriri ne mita 0.75-1 wakati w\u2019ebimera": 2598, "Eddagala eriweweeza ku ffene eririmu ekikomo liyinza okukozesebwa okufuga CBB, naye lirina okusiigibwa ng\u2019obulwadde tebunnafuuka bwa maanyi.": 2599, "Embeera y\u2019obudde: Obudde obutali bulungi ng\u2019ekyeya, enkuba etonnya ennyo, laddu oba ebbugumu erisukkiridde esobola okukosa obubi enkula y\u2019emmwaanyi n\u2019okukendeeza ku makungula.\n\nEbiwuka n\u2019endwadde ezibalukawo: Okubutuka kw\u2019ebiwuka n\u2019endwadde, gamba nga fall armyworm, maize stalk borers, oba maize rust, bisobola okwonoona ennyo ebirime by\u2019emmwaanyi n\u2019okukendeeza ku makungula.\n\nObugimu bw\u2019ettaka obubi: Ebiriisa by\u2019ettaka ebitali bimala oba ebiriisa ebitakwatagana bisobola okukosa enkula y\u2019emmwaanyi n\u2019ebibala.
